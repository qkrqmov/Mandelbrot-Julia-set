# Mandelbrot and Julia Set

Java program showing the relationship between the Mandelbrot and Julia set; it shows a visual representation of both sets. 

Mandelbrot set is a set that uses complex numbers with the real part as the x and the imaginary as the y. Using the coordinates of a points as constant, it is possible to expose the Julia set those coordinate.

## Getting Started

The program consists of a single Java file which requires Java to be installed on the machine. 

The Mandelbrot set is on the left while the Julia set is on the right. Clicking on the Mandelbrot set will show the equivalent Julia set at the position of the click.
